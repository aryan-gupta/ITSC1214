# ITSC1214
Code for my ITSC1214 Data Structures and Algorithms class

## Liability and Honor Code ##
I am NOT responsible for your grade or any Honor Code Violation. I only
place my code on GitHub so I can sync between computers and use version
control. This repository was kept private until final grades were submitted
to prevent violations and cheating, but was then publicized to display my coding
abilities for job interviews and related such. Use at your own risk. 

### Usage ###
 - Folders: A folder for each of the labs
 - Figure out how to compile it
 - Good luck
